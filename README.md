John Paul Haddad SEI-Project 1- Memory Card 

Game Description:
 The game of Memory, also  known as Concentration, was published in today's form Ravensburger  in 1959. The rules require the player to find a matching word, picture, or card from cards placed face down. If the cards the flip over don't match, then they must place them back and commit their location to memory. My modernized version of the game pays homage to the popular Mario Brothers video game with its theme.
